# CountAPI

<p>CountAPI is a spin-off of the beloved <a href="https://countapi.xyz/">OG countapi.</a> Unfortunately, the service is no longer available to the public as a free API due to widely unknown reasons. This service has been created as a very simple version of CountAPI in hopes of getting some users back on their feet again.</p>
        <p>Although this API is a slightly more limited version than the original, it serves a very similar purpose, and I hope it will fulfill the needs of most users looking for something similar. If not, please feel free to email me directly at <a href="mailto:miles@mileshilliard.com">miles@mileshilliard.com</a> and I would be happy to talk! Until the massive traffic explosion I am totally expecting, be satisfied with what you've got. It is free after all!</p>
